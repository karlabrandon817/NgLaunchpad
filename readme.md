Steps:
------
[x] download AngularJS (1.5)
[x] set up basic project JS
[x] set up basic project HTML
[x] our first 2-way bind
[x] our first ng-click
[x] add an array that holds all the movies that have been input on button click
[x] console log out that array
[x] research ng-repeat and see if you can get that info on the DOM
