* AngularJS

Overview
--------
In this guide we'll set up a very simple client-side page that will use AngularJS. You'll need familiarity with HTML, and JS.

Steps:
------
[x] download AngularJS (1.5)<br>
[x] set up basic project JS<br>
[x] set up basic project HTML<br>
[x] our first 2-way bind<br>
[x] our first ng-click<br>
[x] add an array that holds all the movies that have been input on button click<br>
[x] console log out that array<br>
[x] research ng-repeat and see if you can get that info on the DOM<br>
[x] extend this to create an array of objects instead of just strings
[x] wanna try showing/hiding something? look into ng-show and ng-hide
